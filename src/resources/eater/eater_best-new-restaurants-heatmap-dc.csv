Joia Burger,"A year after the original debuted in Mt. Pleasant, nostalgia-inducing burger bar Joia added a second (and much-bigger) D.C. location in April. Joy-filled Joia comes from chef/owner Patrice Cleary, who's also behind essential Filipino place Purple Patch in Mt. Pleasant. Joia 2.0 in Glover Park continues to showcase its wagyu beef (or veggie bean) smash burgers assembled with one, two, or three patties with diced papaya slaw on a potato or gluten-free bun. Skin-on shoestring fries and ube soft serve round out the pint-sized menu.","American Burger Bar","2414 Wisconsin Avenue Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia 20007"

Situated in Seven Reasons' former 14th Street NW home, two-story Elmina carves out room for 124 diners.

Sagrada,"Knead Hospitality + Design transformed the mezzanine level of its 14th Street NW Mexican restaurant Mi Vida into Sagrada, a trippy, sage-scented tasting room that explores the transformative power of psychedelics—through food. While no actual psilocybin is used, the $111-per-person affair mirror the stages of a psychedelic trip across an eight-course journey, from ceremonial cacao poured in clay cups to visually immersive dishes full of mushrooms and beets. Hours are Monday to Friday, with two seatings nightly for a choice of "plant-based" or "flexitarian" menu options.","Experimental Tasting Menu","1901 14th St NW (at T St NW), Washington, D.C. 20009"

The restaurant kicks off with a selection of meze and hot and cold dips like red pepper-and-walnut muhammara, followed by lots of meaty mains like lamb chops, and Greek interpretations of seafood (branzino). Alara also imports best sellers found at Ilhan's Turkish stalwart Ottoman Taverna in Mt. Vernon Triangle. Alara, which brings Georgetown a rare new late-night dining option, takes over the address that long housed Italian darling Paolo's Ristorante until 2018.","Eastern Mediterranean","1303 Wisconsin Avenue Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia 20007"

Martinis are a huge focus here, as seen in the vodka-or-gin "Angie's Dirty Duo" with blue cheese olives, an extra-generous pour on the side, and extra garnishes. NY-based For Five Coffee Roasters, which is also operated by Balos Estiatorio Restaurant Group, fuels its espresso martini.","European Bistro","2300 North Street Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia 20037"

Tapori,"The team behind Eater 38 hit Daru doubled down on H Street this year with a rowdy new South Indian restaurant and cocktail bar. Tapori, which means "vagabond" in Hindi, draws influence from South Indian street markets and Bollywood films that embrace Mumbai culture. Tapori centers around communal eating and flavors that span from Kerala to Nepal. Nepalese chef Suresh Sundas and beverage director Dante Datta teamed up with faraway chef Baburam Sharma to develop a menu that reflects his Nepalese background, upbringing in Delhi, and decades of experience in cooking South Indian cuisine. Dishes like pani puri, vada pav, and dosas join cocktails made with indigenous spices and fruits like chaat masala, jackfruit puree, and hibiscus. The former home of Fancy Radish got a complete overhaul from Edit Lab, complete with a 20-person communal table, patchwork tile-covered bar, and booths peering into the bright open kitchen.","South Indian Street Food","600 H Street Northeast, Washington, District of Columbia 20002"

This marks the first time the flagship of restaurateur Shelly Fireman's hospitality group grows beyond its Big Apple roots. The new location has the same reliable Italian fare, including famous thin-crusted pizza and an antipasti bar overflowing with vegetables and seafood, plus a new wood-fired oven pumping out branzino al Forno, a center-cut veal chop, flame-kissed cheeseburger, and more distinctly smoky mains.","Italian","1001 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia 20004"
Lucky Danger,"Chinese American takeout Lucky Danger unveiled a full-on flagship in May in Penn Quarter. Founded by restaurateur Tim Ma, the food menu is full of allium pancakes with whipped tofu and caviar; blue crab lo mein with leek fondue; and duck fried chaufa (Peruvian fried rice) with fish sauce caramel. The restaurant features four distinct areas: a bright entryway bar with classic cocktails integrating Asian flavors, an intimate dining room, the moody "Lucky Club" with drinks using Chinese herbal medicine, and a green-toned mahjong parlor with over-proof whiskeys.","Chinese-American Fusion","709 D Street Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia 20004"

High-powered art world hospitality group Artfarm, the London-based team behind NY's new Manuela, tapped two D.C. industry vets to lead the charge at Fish Shop's first stateside location. Chef de cuisine Ria Montes and director of operations Angie Duran steer a hyperlocal menu full of trout-topped crumpets, roasted rockfish, and peak spring vegetables sourced from the Dupont farmers market. Its scenic patio just joined the fold, and brunch debuts in June.","Scottish Seafood","610 Water Street Southwest, Washington, District of Columbia 20024"
